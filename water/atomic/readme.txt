// water::atomic
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This is legacy code, it was designed in 2005. It is now obsolete because of std::atomic from the
2011 C++ standard. It should be removed completely or transformed to something that is used only if
std::atomic does not exist.

It still exists because other parts of water depend on it. And it still works.
