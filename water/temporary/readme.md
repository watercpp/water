# water::temporary

`water::temporary` can help in a specific situation:

- Dynamic memory is needed temporarily, but repeatedly over and over with similar needs every time.
- The normal memory allocators are too slow or cause unwanted synchronization between threads.
- The code can be modified to use a special memory allocator.

It works like this:

`#include <water/temporary/memory.hpp>`

A thread has a `water::temporary::memory` memory buffer. It is used from a single thread, each
thread using temporary memory needs its own memory buffer. That memory buffer is allocated from an
underlying allocator and is kept and reused for a long time.

When the thread needs temporary memory for some work, it uses `water::temporary::allocator` to
allocate memory from the `water::temporary::memory` buffer. It is very important that all temporary
memory is freed when the work is done, it should only be used temporarily.

    void thread() {
        temporary::memory<> memory;
        
        while(wait_for_work()) {
        
            auto allocator = allocator_for(memory);
            
            void *raw_memory = allocator.allocate(123);
            do_something(raw_memory, 123);
            allocator.free(raw_memory, 123);
            
            temporary::vector<int, decltype(allocator)> v{allocator};
            for(int i = 0; i != 1000; ++i)
                v.push_back(i);
        }
    }

Using `water::temporary::allocator` to allocate and free raw memory is not fun. It is difficult to
predict what the temporary memory will be used for and prepare easy to use tools for it. But
`temporary::vector` exists, and `temporary::std_allocator<type, memory>` for STL containers.



## temporary::vector

    template<typename value_, typename allocator_, typename sizer_ = void>
    class vector

This class looks almost exactly like `std::vector` but it uses a `temporary::allocator` and is
optimized for temporary memory. A `temporary::allocator` must be used to construct a
`temporary::vector`, unlike `std::vector` where the `std::allocator` is optional.

It also works with allocators that return 0 instead of throwing exceptions. All functions that
modify the vector return an iterator (a pointer) that will be 0 if the allocator returned 0.    

When using two or more `temporary::vector` at the same time, try to fully grow each
`temporary::vector` before adding elements to another. This is the most effective way to use the
`temporary::memory`.

    temporary::memory<> memory;
    using allocator1 = temporary::allocator_throw<temporary::memory<>>;
    using allocator2 = temporary::allocator_nothrow<temporary::memory<>>;
    
    temporary::vector<int, allocator1> v1{allocator1{memory}},
    temporary::vector<int, allocator1> v2{allocator2{memory}};
    
    auto i = v2.push_back(1);
    if(!i)
        memory_allocation_failed();
    
Avoid this:

    for(int i = 0; i != 1000; ++i)Â {
        v1.push_back(i);
        v2.push_back(i);
    }
    
Prefer two loops, or use `reserve(1000)` when the size is known:

    for(int i = 0; i != 1000; ++i)
        v1.push_back(i);
    for(int i = 0; i != 1000; ++i)
        v2.push_back(i);



## temporary::std_allocator

The `temporary::std_allocator` can be used with STL containers or something else that needs a STL
allocator: 

    temporary::memory<> memory;
    using allocator = temporary::std_allocator<int, temporary::memory<>>;
    
    std::list<int, allocator> list{allocator{memory}};

Remember to always use a `temporary::std_allocator` constructed with a `temporary::memory` object,
like the example above. It has a default constructor, but the program will crash if the container
tries to allocate memory using a default-constructed `std_allocator`.



## water::move_pointer and water::later

`water::move_pointer` from `water/move_pointer.hpp` and `water::later` from `water/later.hpp` can
help when working with temporary memory.

    water::temporary::memory<> memory;
    
    auto allocator = allocator_for(memory);

    water::move_pointer<thing, decltype(allocator)> pointer{allocator};
    new(pointer) thing;
    pointer->function();
    
    void *raw_memory = allocator.allocate(123);
    auto raw_memory_free = water::later([raw_memory, allocator] { allocator.free(raw_memory, 123); });
    memcpy(raw_memory, something_else, 123);

`water::move_pointer` is similar to `std::unique_ptr` except it has `operator new` and uses
`water::allocator` type allocators for memory allocation.



## allocator and allocator_nothrow

Allocators can throw or return 0 when they fail to allocate memory:

    water::temporary::memory<> memory;
    
    auto a1 = allocator_for(memory); // throws exception when out of memory
    auto a2 = allocator_nothrow_for(memory); // returns 0
    
    using allocator = water::temporary::allocator_throw<water::temporary::memory<>>;
    using allocator_nothrow = water::temporary::allocator_nothrow<water::temporary::memory<>>;

The `temporary::memory` itself can use a `water::allocator` that throws or returns 0 (it uses one
that returns 0 by default):

    water::temporary::memory<water::allocator> memory_that_throws_exceptions;
    water::temporary::memory<water::allocator_nothrow> memory_that_returns_0;



## water::allocator functions and the lower level push/pop/resize functions

When writing code specifically for `water::temporary` there is the `allocator.allocate` and
`allocator.free` functions that are common to other allocators in `water`. Beyond that there is:

- `allocator.resize(pointer, old_size, new_size)` to grow or shrink an existing allocation
- `push` and `pop` that are similar to `allocate` and `free`
- `push_at_least(size_t& pushed, size_t at_least)` that will allocate as much as possible but at
  least a specific size (shrink it later with `resize`)

Look at `water/temporary/allocator.hpp` to see all functions.

Look at the documentation in `water/temprary/block.hpp` for the lowest level interface.



## Tuning and statistics

To get an idea of how the temporary memory is used, `temporary::memory_track` is a drop-in
replacement for `temporary::memory` that collects statistics. This is slower so do not use it all
the time.

`#include <water/temporary/memory_track.hpp>` instead of `water/temporary/memory.hpp`

Look at `water/temporary/memory_track.hpp` and `water/temporary/statistics.hpp`.

`temporary::memory` holds a few large memory blocks. It will allocate a new block when it's needed,
and at the same time free the smallest unused.

Depending on what the program does, it might be good to have a few large memory blocks in the
`temporary::memory<>` or more but smaller blocks.

    water::temporary::memory<> memory;
    memory.sizer(water::temporary::sizer{1024 * 1024}); // smallest block size is 1 MB
    memory.allocate_and_keep_blocks(3); // and try to keep the 3 largest blocks

It is also possible to pre-allocate memory and prevent any further memory allocation:

    water::temporary::memory<> memory;
    memory.allocate_block(1024 * 1024);
    memory.allocate_block(1024 * 1024);
    memory.allocate_and_keep_blocks(0); // zero means it will never allocate more memory
